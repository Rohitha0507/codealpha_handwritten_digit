# DigitVision AI // Multi-Inference Engine

**DigitVision AI** is an enterprise-grade, production-optimized computer vision system designed to break down, isolate, and read handwritten character streams. By fusing advanced **OpenCV Contour Segmentation Layers** with a deepened **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** trained on the MNIST dataset, this system transitions beyond single-digit limitations to decode multi-digit inputs (e.g., parsing strings like `2026`, `54`, or `789`) instantly within a beautiful dark-mode workspace.

## 🚀 Key Architectural Breakthroughs

* **Multi-Digit Contour Segmentation:** Replaces rigid whole-image analysis with dynamic bounding coordinates. It segments continuous ink strokes, handles variable spacing, and programmatically sorts bounding boxes from left to right to construct structural text output.
* **99%+ Optimized CNN Core:** Upgraded with structural Batch Normalization layers, dense convolutional filters ($32 \rightarrow 64 \rightarrow 128$), and dropout regularization to overcome standard training noise and maximize classification accuracy.
* **Background Contrast Invariant Auto-Flipping:** Contains a defensive preprocessing layer using Otsu's adaptive binarization that analyzes mean pixel densities, flipping canvas values appropriately to accommodate both light and dark document ink formats.
* **Asynchronous Telemetry Distribution:** Integrates an interactive Plotly-driven tracking matrix. Users can alternate a selector switch to monitor raw Softmax probabilities across every captured individual sub-segment on the fly.
* **Elite Glassmorphic SaaS Design:** Crafted with responsive container styling, high-impact gradient typography, micro-padding parameters, and clean fallback cards when idling for inputs.

## 📦 Local Installation & Deployment Steps

Follow these instructions to mirror the environment configuration inside a local development container.

### 1. Replicate Repository Resources

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/DigitVision-AI.git
cd DigitVision-AI

```

### 2. Isolate Virtual Sandbox Environments

```bash
python -m venv venv

# Activate for macOS/Linux shells:
source venv/bin/activate

# Activate for Windows PowerShell:
venv\Scripts\activate

```

### 3. Synchronize Dependency Track List

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

```

### 4. Compile the Deep Neural Network Model

If you need to reproduce or recompile the `model.h5` parameter file with enhanced training rules, execute the training script:

```bash
python train_model.py

```

### 5. Launch the Local Application Server

```bash
streamlit run app.py

```

Open your modern web viewport to `http://localhost:8501` to use the dashboard locally.

## 💡 Operational Pipeline Rules

To maximize classification accuracy when passing array images to the inference node:

```text
[ Raw Input Image ] ──► [ OpenCV Grayscale & Blur ] ──► [ Otsu's Binary Threshold Inversion ]
                                                                       │
[ Sequence String Output ] ◄── [ CNN Matrix Inference ] ◄── [ Sorted Left-to-Right Boxes ]

```

1. **Horizontal Consistency:** Ensure multi-digit sequences are written along a clean horizontal line.
2. **Structural Spacing:** Leave clear margins between adjacent characters; overlapping strokes can cause two numbers to be read as a single grouped segment.
3. **Contrast Optimization:** While the adaptive background auto-flipper accounts for contrast variations, high-contrast inputs consistently provide the cleanest feature mappings.
